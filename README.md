Smart Home Automation using ESP32 and IoT Dashboard
# Smart Home Automation System (IoT)

## Objective
To design and implement a smart home automation system that controls multiple appliances wirelessly using an IoT dashboard.

## Appliances Controlled
- Light
- light
- light

## Components Used
- ESP32 Dev Board
- Relay Module / Motor Driver
- Appliances (Light, Fan, Motor)
- Power Supply
- Jumper Wires

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 Web Server / Blynk / MQTT
- Arduino IDE

## Working
The ESP32 acts as a central controller and connects to an IoT dashboard.  
Users can control home appliances wirelessly through the dashboard interface.  
Commands received from the dashboard are processed by ESP32 to switch appliances ON or OFF.

## Dashboard Control
An IoT dashboard is used to control appliances remotely over WiFi.

## Result
The system successfully allows real-time wireless control of multiple appliances using ESP32.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical smart home automation solution using IoT technologies and embedded systems.
